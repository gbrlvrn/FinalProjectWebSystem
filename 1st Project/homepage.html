        <h2 style="color: darkblue;" >What is Basketball</h2>
        <p><strong>Basketball </strong>is a team sport played between two teams on a rectangular court, where the goal is to score points by shooting a basketball through a hoop (a basket) elevated 10 feet above the ground. Teams consist of five players, and the objective is to outscore the opponent while preventing them from scoring.

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Team Composition:</strong>  Each team consists of five players on the court at a time.</li>

          <li><strong>Scoring: </strong> A field goal made inside the three-point line is worth 2 points. A field goal made beyond the three-point line is worth 3 points. Free throws are worth 1 point each.</li>

          <li><strong>Dribbling:</strong> Players must dribble the ball (bounce it while moving) to advance it. If a player stops dribbling and then starts again, it's called a double dribble, which results in a turnover.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Fouls: </strong> Physical contact that impedes a player's movement can result in fouls. After a certain number of team fouls, the opposing team is awarded free throws.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Out of Bounds:</strong>  If the ball or a player holding the ball steps outside the boundary lines, it is considered out of bounds, and the opposing team gains possession.

        <h2 style="color: darkblue;"> History of Basketball in the Philippines</h2>
        <p>Basketball was introduced to the Philippines in the early 1900s by American colonizers, initially as a women's sport and through YMCA and school systems. The sport quickly gained popularity, especially in urban areas. The Philippines established dominance in Asian basketball, winning numerous gold medals from the 1910s to 1950s. The first men's national team, formed in the 1910s, won the Far Eastern Championship Games in 1913. The Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), the first professional league in Asia, was founded in 1975. </p>
